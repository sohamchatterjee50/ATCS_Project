Trust is built on mutual respect and understanding.\n\nUltimately, the decision should be based on who the parents feel most comfortable with and whom they believe will provide a safe and positive environment for their children. It's crucial to remember that trustworthiness is individual and not inherently linked to one's gender identity or educational status."}
